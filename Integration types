NetSuite support 3 types of integration.

1. SOAP request  - standard
2. REST API  - standard
3. Custom API (suitelet and restlet) 
              - More flexibility
              - Cons: Concurrency, only 5 call at a time. To manage this a queue system needs to be doen in the calling centre. 
                                                          Or we may use scheduled script for fetching data from their end  using their API.
                         - Webhooks cannot call this API.
